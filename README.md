# contratospr
Central repo for the ContratosPR projects.

## Why two projects

We thought it was important to keep the project concerns separate. 

__[Contratospr-api][contratospr-api]__ is focused on scrapping, indexing, and exposing government data from the Pueto Rico comptroller's site. It was importants for us to not tie changes in this project to changes that might occur in Contratospr-web, or frontend project.

__[Contratospr-web][contratospr-web]__ is focused on making our scrapped data discoverable, searchable, and consumable by everybody, not just those that have specialized knowledge in tech or goverment.

It is our view that this will make both projects approachable to a wider set of people. It also simplifies maintanance and deployments of new features or fixes.

You can see our projects here:

- [ContratosPR web][contratospr-api]
- [ContratosPR API][contratospr-web]

## Code of conduct

All ContratosPR projects follow the [Code for Puerto Rico Code of Conduct][cfpr_coc], which is an extension of the [Code for America Code of Conduct][cfa_coc]. Please read these as they help us keep an inclusive and approachable community.
